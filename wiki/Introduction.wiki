I have always wanted to have a timeline of historical events which allows addition of events by all - something like Wikipedia. The hope is that such a project will result in a large set of events.

Such a timeline will have the following basic features:
  * Lateral movement of the timeline (move left and right)
  * Zoom in/out (See smaller or larger time durations)

I believe such a tool will give students of history and interested individuals a better understanding of historical events and the timescales involved.

Look at the [Requirements Requirements wiki page] for some more detailed Requirements.

= Tools =
  * The Simile timeline widget - http://www.simile-widgets.org/timeline/
  * Ruby on Rails
  * JQuery

You should start with reading a bit about the Simile timeline to start with. It is essentially intelligent Javascript/HTML which renders a pretty timeline. The source of events is an XML file. In this manner, its a static timeline.

The idea is to generate this source XML for Simile timeline dynamically. The web application should retrieve events from DB, construct the events XML on the fly and ask Simile to render it.
