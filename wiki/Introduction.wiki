#summary What is this?

= Introduction =

I have always wanted to have a timeline of historical events which allows addition of events by all - something like Wikipedia. The hope is that such a project will result in a large set of events.

Such a timeline will have the following basic features:
  * Lateral movement of the timeline (move left and right)
  * Zoom in/out (See smaller or larger time durations)

I believe such a tool will give students of history and interested individuals a better understanding of historical events and the timescales involved.
