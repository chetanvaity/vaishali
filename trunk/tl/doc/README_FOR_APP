Use this README file to introduce your application and point to useful places in the API for learning more.
Run "rake doc:app" to generate API documentation for your models, controllers, helpers, and libraries.

Things to do:
  * Text should not overflow the event divs (WORKAROUND - coloured div area made small)
  * Divs at the same time should overlap or come one below the other (HACKED - cycle 3 divs vertically)
  * Time scale should be visible - with vertical lines
  * Range events
  * Move timeline left and right
  * Zoom
  * 

Doubts:
  * Why don't spans or divs get positioned corrcetly with left and bottom. They do get positioned with left and top.
